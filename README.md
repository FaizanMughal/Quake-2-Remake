# Quake 2 Remake

The Quake 2 Remake is a remastering of Quake 2 originally created by ID Software in 1997. The project is to not only remaster and improve the visuals, but to also add tweaks to the game that give the game smoother gameplay while keeping the game as close to the original product as possible.

The project is being remade in Unity 2018.3 utilizing the High Definition Render Pipeline. So not only are the graphics are being updated, but lighting and and physics are also going to be improved upon. There will be changes not happening like adding new weapon and gunplay.
